Hi there âœ¨ðŸš€

I'm Vladyslav Filatov!

First-year Mobile Devices App Development student, future App Developer. My passion for App Development brought me to the Instituto Superior de Tecnologias AvanÃ§adas de Lisboa, where I am working towards becoming a mobile App Developer.

During my studies I mastered Python, Java, Android, Kotlin, Swift, MySQL/MariaBD, SQLite, 3D Max, Adobe XD, Photoshop and Illustrator. I continue to build skills in programming languages and learn new things.
